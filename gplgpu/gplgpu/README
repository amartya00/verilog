Running the test suite:
under the run directory and test suite, use the command 'runsim -a'
This will run all tests and put the results in passed/ failed/ no_expected.
Without any changes the tests should pass.
Note, with the current state of runsim, the default simulator is VCS. There is commented out code for running modelsim/ questa. The tests are set to run with a data width of 128. I'll add in updates to run 64 and 32 bit wide memory interfaces in the near future.

Running a single test:

Building a project:

2D/3D/NoVGA:
There are options which I will define in detail once I verify operation.
Currently the core is setup to implement a 2D/ 3D core with VGA.
Leaving out the VGA should work fine. I have not tried the 2D option in a while, so it may not currently work correctly. This is my first priority.
